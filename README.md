<h1>Malbox(Malicious Box)</h1>
`Biggest threat in cyber world is not external anonymous tools, but hidden files on our system.`

Malbox is a educational project, where we make and test various kinds of malicious tools, like virus, RAT, Trojans, Keylogger, etc.

All the tools in `Malbox` could or not be malicious directly, so opening the repo in a sandbox or virttual environment is recommended.
